 * Requirements of the assignment:
 * Provide a parallell version of the Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in a Graph.
 * The implementation MUST use a message passing paradigm, and has to be implemented by using MPI.
 * Students MUST store and load the input graph FROM FILES. The whole graph MUST be distributed on files
 * on each node (i.e.: the whole graph cannot be stored on a single (even replicated) file). Good Graph
 * dimensions are greater than 4GB of data. Students have to choose the proper data structure to
 * represent the graph in memory.
 *
 * Purpose of the file:
 * This file contains the implementation of the functions required to comunicate all the structures between processes.
 * The provided functions are:
 *      void send_all(SubGraph *graph, SCCResult *result, int shrink,int dest)
 *      void recv_all(SubGraph **graph, SCCResult **result, int *shrink,int source)
