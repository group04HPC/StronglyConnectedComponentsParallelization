 * Requirements of the assignment:
 * Provide a parallell version of the Tarjan's algorithm to find Strongly Connected Components in a Graph. 
 * The implementation MUST use a message passing paradigm, and has to be implemented by using MPI. 
 * Students MUST store and load the input graph FROM FILES. The whole graph MUST be distributed on files 
 * on each node (i.e.: the whole graph cannot be stored on a single (even replicated) file). Good Graph 
 * dimensions are greater than 4GB of data. Students have to choose the proper data structure to 
 * represent the graph in memory.
